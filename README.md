<h1>Welcome to Heading Up! </h1>
<p>Heading Up is a simple Sinatra Application using ActiveRecord that has brought my two passions of lacrosse and coding together. This application was built to show the MVC framework, as well as a showcase for some RESTful API and CRUD abilities. If you would like to view the code behind the machine, this can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jck13mad/headingup">my github</a>. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!</p>
